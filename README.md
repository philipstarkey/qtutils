## Summary

QtUtils is a Python library that provides some convenient features to Python applications using the PyQt/PySide widget library.

QtUtils contains the following components:

* invoke_in_main: This provides some helper functions to interact with Qt from threads. 

* UiLoader: This provides a simplified means of promoting widgets in *.ui files to a custom widget of your choice.

* qsettings_wrapper: A wrapper around QSettings which allows you to access keys of QSettings as instance attributes. It also performs automatic type conversions.

* icons: An icon set that is automatically built into a QResource file and corresponding Python module on import. The resulting resource file can be used by Qt designer, and the python module imported by applications to make the icons available to them.

* Qt: a PyQt/PySide agnostic interface to Qt that allows you to write software using the PyQt5 API but have it run on either PyQt5, PyQt4 or PySide v1.
