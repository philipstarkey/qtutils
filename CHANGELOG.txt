Version 2.2.0 released Jul 20 2018
----------------------------------
* Added tentative PySide2 (i.e. Qt for Python) support.
* Added alias QtCore.QItemSelectionModel -> QtGui.QItemSelectionModel on PyQt4.
* Added support for carriage returns in OutputBox.
* Bundled Ubuntu monospace font for consistent font in OutputBox across platforms.
  This font is bundled under the terms of the Ubuntu font license included in this
  repository.
* Allow a zmq Context to be passed to OutputBox at instantiation. This allows a custom
  Context to be used, intended for use with a zprocess.SecureContext for encrypted
  messages.
* Allow the binding interface to be specified for OutputBox. This allows the OutputBox
  to potentially receive messages over the network. Intended for use with zprocess's 
  in-development remote processes features.
