QtUtils
=======
QtUtils is a Python library that provides convenient tools for Python Developers creating applications using the PyQt/PySide widget library.

Utilities include those providing thread-safe access to Qt objects, simplified QSettings storage, and dynamic widget promotion when loading UI files. 
QtUtils also includes the Fugue icon set, free to use with attribution to `Yusuke Kamiyamane`_.

.. note::
   `qtutils` 4.0 dropped support for PySide2. If you need to use PySide2, use `qtutils` 3.1.0 or earlier.
